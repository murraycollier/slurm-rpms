BACKFILL-TEST README
====================
The backfill-test can also function as a standalone backfill and
select plugin emulator. After running `make check`, the
`backfill-test` binary will be located in the `.libs` directory.

USAGE
-----
To use `backfill-test`, you need to:

1. Specify the directory containing the required configuration files
   using the `-c` option.
2. Specify the input test file that lists the jobs to be processed
   using the `-t` option.

TEST FILE FORMAT
----------------
Each line in the test file represents a job specification.
The format is as follows (space delimited):

- First number: `job_id` (if set to `0`, it will be assigned automatically).
- Second number: Job priority.
- Third number: Requested number of nodes.
- Fourth number: Time limit for the job.

Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
